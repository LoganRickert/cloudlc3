                        <p>Binary is the numbering system that computers use.
                        Most people are use to the decimal numbering system. The
                        decimal system uses the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and
                        9 to represent numbers while the binary system only uses
                        the numbers 1 and 0.</p>
                        <p>
                            When counting in decimal, when you reach the number 9,
                            you cycle back to zero and add a 1 to the next column.
                            8, 9, 10. 18, 19, 20. Binary works in the same way, but
                            instead of cycling at 9, it cycles at one. 0, 1, 10. 1101,
                            1110, 1111. Binary has less digits to work with and therefore
                            numbers are a lot longer than in decimal. An example would be
                            '111' in binary is '7' in decimal.
